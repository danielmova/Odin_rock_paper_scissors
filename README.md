# The Odin Project - Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Reflection

This project was fun! I really enjoyed the challenge of creating functions and diving into JavaScript. Discovering how easily I could run code directly in the browser terminal.

I mostly relied on the browser's developer tools for debugging, stepping through my code at each stage. My code is messy and convoluted, but I'm genuinely proud of building a working program from scratch.

## Enoyng thintgs that I found along the way:

* **AI Autocomplete:** While VS Code's AI autocomplete is great for repetitive tasks, I found it hindered my learning process when used for general code writing. It tended to do the thinking for me, which wasn't as fun or educational.

* **Git Issue:** At the end of the project, I encountered a "fatal: bad object HEAD" error with Git. I wasn't sure how to resolve it, so I ended up deleting my local repository and cloning it again. While this fixed the issue, I know it's not the ideal solution. I'd like to learn a proper way to handle this in the future.
